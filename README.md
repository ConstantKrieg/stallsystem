# Stall System

This is a personal project that I use for convenience. It fetches information from multiple sources, assembles the data into a single structure and provides endpoints for the reshaped data. 

Since some of the API licenses do not allow for a  complete application to be published for public use, all the endpoints are behind an authentication layer. Additionally, the software assumes that a database with specific schema is in place.
